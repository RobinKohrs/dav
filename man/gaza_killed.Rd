\title{Fetches the complete list of known individuals killed in Gaza}
\usage{
gaza_killed(format = "df", page = NULL, minified = TRUE, progress = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{format}{A string specifying the format.
\itemize{
\item "df" (default): Fetches all pages sequentially and combines them into a single data frame. Most robust method.
\item "csv": Downloads the complete dataset as a single CSV file and returns a data frame.
\item "json": Downloads the complete dataset as a single minified JSON file.
\item "page": Returns a specific page number (requires page parameter).
}}

\item{page}{Integer. Page number (1-602). Only used when format = "page".}

\item{minified}{Logical. Whether to return minified JSON. Default is TRUE.}

\item{progress}{Logical. Whether to show progress bar for multi-page downloads. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the list of names and associated details, or raw JSON content.
}
\description{
This function retrieves the dataset of names of those killed in Gaza. The recommended
method is using the default \code{format = "df"}, which fetches the data page by page
to avoid long request times and potential timeouts with the full file.
}
\details{
\strong{Data Source and Updates:}
The file is updated when a new list is released by Gaza's Ministry of Health.

This list incorporates the following releases from the Ministry of Health:
\itemize{
\item \strong{First release} (January 5th, 2024): Hospitals reporting in the South and November 2nd 2023 for the North. Additionally, 21 records were included from an earlier release as noted in the February update.
\item \strong{Second release} (March 29th, 2024): Included submissions from the public to the Ministry (i.e., families of those killed). Changes detailed in April 29th update.
\item \strong{Third release} (April 30th, 2024): Released on May 5th from the Ministry. Changes detailed in June 26th update.
\item \strong{Fourth release} (June 30th, 2024): Released on July 24th from the Ministry. Changes detailed in September 7th update.
\item \strong{Fifth release} (August 31st, 2024): Released around September 15th by the Ministry. Changes detailed in September 21st update.
\item \strong{Sixth release} (March 23rd, 2025): Released on the same day by the Ministry via Iraq Body Count. Changes detailed in May 11th update.
\item \strong{Seventh release} (June 15th, 2025): Released on June 23rd from the Ministry via Iraq Body Count. Changes detailed in July 6th update.
\item \strong{Eighth release} (July 15th, 2025): Released on July 16th from the Ministry via Iraq Body Count. Changes detailed in July 20th update.
\item \strong{Ninth release} (July 31st, 2025): Released on August 4th from the Ministry via Iraq Body Count. Changes detailed in August 17th update.
}

\strong{Data Limitations:}
In their initial January 2024 update, the Ministry indicated the following about the list:
\itemize{
\item The missing persons and the bodies of those trapped under the rubble were not counted
\item The unidentified people who arrived at hospitals were not counted
\item The unidentified persons whose bodies were handed over by the occupation were not counted
\item Those who were buried by their families without passing through hospitals were not counted
\item The victims in Gaza and North Gaza were not counted after the date of stopping the information system in November
}

The aggregate numbers in the Daily Casualties - Gaza dataset will necessarily diverge from this list due to the number of unidentified people.

\strong{Data Fields:}
Each record contains:
\itemize{
\item \code{name}: Original Arabic name from the source list
\item \code{en_name}: English name translation
\item \code{id}: Unique string identifier (format may change)
\item \code{dob}: Date of birth in YYYY-MM-DD format, or empty string if not available
\item \code{sex}: "m" for male or "f" for female
\item \code{age}: Age as a number
\item \code{source}: Source indicator - "h" (Ministry of Health), "c" (Public Submission), "j" (judicial or house committee), "u" (unknown)
}
}
\examples{
# Get the data as a data frame by fetching all pages (recommended)
killed_df = gaza_killed()

# Get the full dataset directly from the CSV endpoint
killed_from_csv = gaza_killed(format = "csv")

# Get a specific page
page_1 = gaza_killed(format = "page", page = 1)

# Get without progress bar
data = gaza_killed(progress = FALSE)
