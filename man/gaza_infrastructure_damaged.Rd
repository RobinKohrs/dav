\description{
Fetches data on damaged infrastructure in Gaza
}
\details{
\strong{Data Source:}
For infrastructure damage data, the dataset depends on Government Media Office (GMO) in Gaza. Reports are provided roughly once every week (as of 2024) and it's unclear how frequently government officials are updating these numbers between reports. For that reason they should be treated as estimates, especially given the magnitude and the difficulty for non-combatants to enter certain regions in Gaza where Israeli forces are present.

\strong{Data Context:}
Gaza is nearly entirely destroyed. By some estimates over 90\% of buildings and infrastructure have been targeted in some way. Updates on these statistics have slowed from the earlier weekly frequency to every month or longer.

\strong{Extrapolated Fields:}
Since official numbers weren't always available, and it can be useful to have a timeseries where all dates have values, extrapolated fields (prefixed with "ext_") are provided. For more recent numbers in 2024, these fields will display the latest known value for the last received report date. For earlier reports that were less consistent, incrementing daily values are derived using the difference between two known reporting periods in order to be consistent with how ext_ values are provided in other daily datasets.

\strong{Data Fields:}
Each daily report contains fields for:
\itemize{
\item \code{report_date}: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format
\item \code{civic_buildings.destroyed}: Cumulative number of government buildings destroyed
\item \code{civic_buildings.ext_destroyed}: Same as above but extrapolated
\item \code{educational_buildings.destroyed}: Cumulative number of educational buildings destroyed
\item \code{educational_buildings.ext_destroyed}: Same as above but extrapolated
\item \code{educational_buildings.damaged}: Cumulative number of educational buildings partially damaged
\item \code{educational_buildings.ext_damaged}: Same as above but extrapolated
\item \code{places_of_worship.mosques_destroyed}: Cumulative number of mosques destroyed
\item \code{places_of_worship.ext_mosques_destroyed}: Same as above but extrapolated
\item \code{places_of_worship.mosques_damaged}: Cumulative number of mosques partially damaged
\item \code{places_of_worship.ext_mosques_damaged}: Same as above but extrapolated
\item \code{places_of_worship.churches_destroyed}: Cumulative number of churches destroyed
\item \code{places_of_worship.ext_churches_destroyed}: Same as above but extrapolated
\item \code{residential.destroyed}: Cumulative number of residential units destroyed
\item \code{residential.ext_destroyed}: Same as above but extrapolated
}

\strong{Note on Mosque Classification:}
The distribution of destroyed vs. damaged mosques shifted considerably in May. In their May 18th report, the number of mosques classified as destroyed sharply increased, while the number classified as damaged decreased. It's unclear whether this is due to reporting difficulties, delays, or a change in classification approach.
