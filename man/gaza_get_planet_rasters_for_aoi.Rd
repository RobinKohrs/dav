\title{Find, Filter, and Crop Rasters by a Polygon AOI}
\usage{
gaza_get_planet_rasters_for_aoi(
  aoi_path,
  aoi_name = "cropped",
  tile_index_path,
  output_dir,
  overlap_threshold = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{aoi_path}{A character string. The full path to the polygon file
(e.g., GeoPackage, Shapefile) defining your Area of Interest.}

\item{aoi_name}{the prefixed name for the cropped rasters. E.g "gaza_city" till turn
the rasters names into gaza_city_<raster_name>}

\item{tile_index_path}{A character string. The full path to the master
GeoPackage or Shapefile that contains the footprints of all your rasters.}

\item{output_dir}{A character string. The path to the directory where the
newly cropped rasters will be saved. The directory will be created if
it does not exist.}

\item{overlap_threshold}{A numeric value between 0 and 1. The minimum
required overlap as a proportion of the AOI's total area. For example,
0.5 means the raster's footprint must cover at least 50\% of the AOI.
Defaults to 0.5.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a character vector containing the full paths to
the newly created cropped raster files.
}
\description{
This function automates the process of selecting raster files that
significantly overlap with a given Area of Interest (AOI) polygon,
then crops and saves them. It uses namespace-qualified function calls
(e.g., terra::vect) for robustness and does not require packages to be loaded.
