\title{Find Rasters Intersecting an AOI (Polygon or Points)}
\usage{
gaza_find_rasters_for_aoi(aoi_path, tile_index_path, overlap_threshold = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{aoi_path}{A character string. The full path to the spatial file
(e.g., GeoPackage, Shapefile) defining your Area of Interest.}

\item{tile_index_path}{A character string. The full path to the master vector
file (e.g., GeoPackage, Shapefile) containing the footprints of all rasters.}

\item{overlap_threshold}{A numeric value between 0 and 1. If the AOI is a
polygon, this specifies the minimum required overlap as a proportion of the
AOI's total area. Defaults to 0.5. Ignored for point AOIs.}
}
\value{
A character vector of full paths to the raster files that meet the
intersection criteria. Returns an empty character vector if no rasters are found.
}
\description{
This function identifies raster files from a tile index that intersect with a
given Area of Interest (AOI), which can be a polygon or a set of points. It
returns a character vector of the full paths to the qualifying raster files.
