### Open Finder with Shortcut

It sucks to open finder with a shortcut configured via apple script because it alwas brings up all the windows of Finder on the current workspace while what you actually want is to only bring the newly created one on top. E.g. this script works, but does exactly that...

```
on run {input, parameters}

    tell application "Finder"
        -- Check if there are NO Finder windows open
        if (count of Finder windows) is 0 then
            -- If no windows are open, make exactly one new window.
            -- This will open in the current Space.
            make new Finder window
        end if
        
        -- Whether a window was just opened or already existed,
        -- bring Finder to the front (activating it in the current Space).
        activate
    end tell
    
    return input
end run
```

-> Better look [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/163790/596385) and just use opt+cmd-space to open finder!
